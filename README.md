Hi!  :wave:

I am Nikolay. I work in the field of data analysis, data science and data engineering.  

I solve tasks connected with NLP, ML in general, ETL, data processing and visualization.  

I use Python, SQL and some popular frameworks to solve my tasks: SpaCy, Transformers, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash, etc.
I also have some experience in working with LLM via API.

 To demonstrate my skills I posted descriptions of several of my work projects down below. :computer:

### NLP Text Classification and Information Extraction


In this project I solved two major tasks:  
1. *Text categorization* - I have a predefined list of categories and I need to detect which categories from this list a text belongs to. One text can belong to many categories, so it's a kind of multiclassification task. The set of texts for this task contains information about clients' interests, but some extra information as well.  
2. *Information extraction* - I have a column with texts which contain career information. My task is to extract words that mean professions from these texts. I can divide this task on two steps:
  

    * words labeling
    * words extraction based on that label
      
Besides, using the obtained results I need to build the model which will detect the objects of two tasks listed above.

To reach these goals I used SpaCy and wrote a module in Python to make NLP-processing of texts more comfortable and automatic and to extend some possibilities of this processing.

### NLP Spam Detection

This project consisted of two tasks:  

1) to find spam-messages in the set of texts I received from the client and to remove them  

2) to build a model which will be able to detect spam-messages

To solve these tasks I used pretrained SpaCy model for the Russian language and my own module in Python.

### Models and Blast Furnace Processes Visualization
This project was big and long. It included many tasks: ETL, data processing and analysing, training and testing models, visualization of processes and results.  

The main purpose of this project was to create a digital advisor for the blast furnace which will help employees to control and manage the furnace.  

I participated in all stages of this project and solved different tasks, the main part of which I can't publish due to privacy, but here I want to show several examples of the visualization I have done.

### Automated Excel Report Writer


Despite creation a plenty of advanced analytic software, which have many different options for consolidation, processing, analysis and visualization of data, Microsoft Excel is one of the most popular data tools.  
One of its main advantages is its wide use. If you save a report in Excel standard and send it, with great probability your recipients can open it in their computers.  
 So Excel format is still popular, and if you work as a data analyst and use Python like me you can get tasks where you need to save Excel reports from Python.  


To automate this task and to minimize manual work risks, I developed a special Python module that can help to build as complex an Excel report as you need.

### Python Mail Sender


If you have this kind of task, Python allows sending email messages using built-in libraries (SMTP, email, IMAP).  

To make work with mailing list easier without deep immersion into these libraries I wrote a small module in Python.
