### NLP Text Classification and Word Classification


The main goal of this project was an information extraction from raw unstructured text.<br>
I got the dataset with the columns which contained an information about clients' career and interests as unstructured text with a lot of unnecessary information.  
Regarding the career I needed to remain only words meant name of professions.  
In the case of interests I had to categorize the texts in the 50 specified categories, for example: 'Astronomy and space', 'Sports and fitness', 'Stocks, investment opportunities, investing money', etc.  
To reach these goals I used Spacy and wrote several useful functions in Python.  
I prepared learning data and fine-tuned pretrained models for English and Russian to recognize the words related to professions.
I also added the layer of text categorization into the models and trained it.
The trained models show a good ability to generalize.
