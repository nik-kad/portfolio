### NLP Text Classification and Word Classification


The main goal of this project was an information extraction from raw unstructured text.</b>
I got the dataset with the columns which contained an information about clients' career and interests as unstructured text with a lot of unnecessary information.

Regarding the career I needed to remain only words meant name of professions.

In the case of interests I had to categorize the texts in 50 specified categories.
